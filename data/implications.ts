      "A direct model swap from Claude Opus to Seed2.0 Pro could reduce costs by ~90% on input and ~90% on output",
      "Implement intelligent routing: Pro for hard tasks, Lite for medium, Mini for simple — can cut blended cost by 5-10x",
      "The Mini tier at $0.03/M input enables use cases previously too expensive to justify (logging analysis, bulk classification)",
      "Factor in the switching cost: prompt engineering, eval pipeline updates, and edge case handling will require investment",
